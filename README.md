## Welcome to Group 1 project repository.

**To run the project, first clone it. Type npm i to install all of the dependencies. Then type npm start in the console command in the main folder to start the frontend, then go to the backend folder and type npm run start to start the backend.**

## Note to monitors

**The project was originally set to private and you need an account on the whitelist to access this repo. However, our professor clarified to us later on that we don't have to secure this site. As the result of this, the personal report of some team members may still state that you need a special account to access, but that's no longer to case. We are sorry for any inconvenience.**
